Comnplete the list component, which accepts an items prop and moves the clicked element to the first place in the list.

For example, if the component has the list prop ["A","B","C"], the list should look like:

    <ul>
      <li>A</li>
      <li>B</li>
      <li>C</li>
    </ul>

When item B is clicked in the list above, the list should be reordered, resulting in the following order:

    <ul>
      <li>A</li>
      <li>B</li>
      <li>C</li>
    </ul>
